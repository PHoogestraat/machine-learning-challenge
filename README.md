# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

The Kepler Space Observatory is a NASA-build satellite that was launched in 2009. The telescope is dedicated to searching for exoplanets in star systems besides our own, with the ultimate goal of possibly finding other habitable planets besides our own. The original mission ended in 2013 due to mechanical failures, but the telescope has nevertheless been functional since 2014 on a "K2" extended mission.

Kepler had verified 1284 new exoplanets as of May 2016. As of October 2017 there are over 3000 confirmed exoplanets total (using all detection methods, including ground-based ones). The telescope is still active and continues to collect new data on its extended mission.

To process this data, three machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset were created. This process was exacuted in the following stages:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Models](#Models)
3. [Reporitng](#Reporting)

## Process

### Preprocess the Data
Data was optained from the [Exoplanet Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results) and evaluated.


* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Models

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
